# Coding Challenges

Compilation from coding problems courtesy of
[DailyCodingProblem.com](https://www.dailycodingproblem.com/)
(except they're done sporadically and not in order  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ ). 

I plan on using these challenges to practice Python (which I am learning to love).
I am thoroughly enjoying coding these as efficiently as possibly, so if you find any
way to optimize my functions feel free to share/critique!
